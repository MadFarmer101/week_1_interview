###Question 1 - Variables###

1. Create a variable and set it equal to 'variable'.
    variable = 'variable'

2. What are some different data types? Write a few examples.
    Strings = 'string'
    Integers = 1
    Floats = 3.14
    Boolean = true/false
    Symbol = :symbol
    Arrays = []
    Hashes = {key: value} 


###Question 2 - Hashes and Arrays###

1. Open irb. Create two hashes, one for each car, with the following attributes: wheels, max_speed, color
    car1 = {wheels: 4, max_speed: 200, color: 'red'}
    car2 = {wheels: 3, max_speed: 50, color: 'yellow'}

2. Create an array that contains both cars.
    cars = [car1, car2]

3. How do we find the seconds car's color?
    cars[1][:color]


###Question 3 - Classes and Methods###

1. Create a new folder called ​cars​ and inside of that folder, create a file called ​car.rb​ with:
- a class Car 
- a method to "paint" a car a new color. Open irb. Load your 'car.rb' file. Create aninstance of a Car and change its color.
    
    Answer is on car.rb file


###Question 4 - Rspec###
1. How do you initialize ​rspec​ in a folder? Do it in our cars folder.
    Did it in cars folder

2. We would ordinarily have written our tests first, then written code to make them pass.Why?
    - It gives a code a nice directions to follow. If we're trying to write a method to pass a test on a certain feature, we are only focused on that.
    - By writting test you can better have a felling of UI with the code.
    - It makes a code look nice and easily understandable.
    - We know that code works.
    - You can easily refactor the code.

3. Create a unit test for our ​Car​ class to test our "painting" method.
    Created it in a car_spec.rb file.

4. A car should have a driver. Create an ​instance_double​​Driver​. Write a second test forthis and make it pass.
    Created it in car_spec.rb and car.rb files.
